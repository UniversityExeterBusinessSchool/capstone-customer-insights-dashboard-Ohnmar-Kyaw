# Capstone Project: Customer Insights Dashboard (Weeks 9–11)

## Scenario
You are working as a junior business analyst in a digital retail company.  
Your manager has asked you to develop a **Python-based dashboard** that helps the team visualise and understand **customer purchase behaviour**.  

The dashboard should:
- Load and process **customer, product, and purchase data**  
- Compute **key business metrics** (spend, churn, popular products)  
- Display results using **visualisations**  
- Handle errors gracefully  
- Include **unit tests** for the analytical functions  
- Reflect on the role of **AI coding assistants** in your development process  

---

## Core Requirements

### Week 9 – Testing and AI Coding
#### Unit Testing
- Write unit tests (with `pytest`) for at least **3 core analytics functions**:
  - Total spend per customer
  - Churn rate
  - Most popular product
- Demonstrate running tests locally and interpreting results.

#### AI Assistant Reflection
- Experiment with an AI coding assistant (e.g., Copilot, ChatGPT).  
- Document:
  - Which part of the code you asked the AI to help with.  
  - How you reviewed/refined the AI’s suggestions.  
  - Risks/ethical considerations.  

---

### Week 10 – Dashboard Development
#### Core Features
- Build a **dashboard script** (`dashboard.py`) that:
  - Loads data from CSV/JSON  
  - Computes **summary metrics**  
  - Displays **visualisations** (Matplotlib/Seaborn/Plotly if available):  
    - Bar chart of top products  
    - Churn rate visualisation (pie or bar)  
    - Spend by customer (bar chart)  
- Include a **menu or simple UI** (e.g., text menu or notebook interface) to choose what to view.  
- Save **dashboard outputs** (charts or summary JSON) to the `data/` folder.  

---

### Week 11 – Wrap-Up and Reflection
#### Final Deliverables
- A **Python dashboard** (structured code + charts).  
- A **tests/** folder with pytest test cases.  
- A **README.md** that:
  - Explains how to run the dashboard.  
  - Shows example screenshots of the charts (optional).  
  - Reflects on your learning:
    - Use of Python (lists, loops, dictionaries, classes, files, visualisation).  
    - Role of AI assistants in your coding.  
    - Improvements you’d make with more time.  

---

## Optional
- Add an **interactive dashboard** (e.g., with `Streamlit` or `Dash`).  
- Allow filtering by **date range** or **customer segment**.  
- Save charts automatically to `.png` files.  
- Export metrics to **Excel/CSV** for reporting.
